# Deploy SciChat Logbook with Dimension Integration üõ†Ô∏èüí¨  

This repository provides the setup for deploying the **Dimension Integration** and **Riot Matrix** applications at the **European Spallation Source (ESS)**. The system serves as a **SciChat logbook** to enable scientists to view and discuss their data in a chat-based interface.

---

## Features ‚ú®  

- **SciChat Integration**: Chat-based logbook for viewing scientific data.  
- **Dimension Integration**: Synchronizes with ESS systems for seamless data management.  
- **Riot Matrix**: Provides a secure and scalable chat platform.  

---

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è  

- Kubernetes cluster.  
- Helm installed and configured.  
- Access to ESS DMSC infrastructure.
